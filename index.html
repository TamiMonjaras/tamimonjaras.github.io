	<font color="#9EE3F1" style="font-family: allan; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 25px">Oh, right, let's get to the point: the reason why I love watching animated series is because some of them have a great plot, story, characters, design, soundtrack,etc; but, what differences them from a movie, play and other visual forms of entertainement is that I love the drawing and colouring made by the animators, the style of the expressions and actions, the effort and work behind every frame. Most of cartoons are colorful and cheerful. Some, are sort of darker. There are some examples:
